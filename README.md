# THREE.js-Gamepad-Joystick-Tester
THREE.js &amp; JS Gamepad API Integration Joystick Tester. This program helps test the JavaScript Gamepad API joysticks in a web browser with THREE.js integration. I don't have any interaction with other buttons (just joysticks), but I can make something if popularly requested. Use as needed :)
